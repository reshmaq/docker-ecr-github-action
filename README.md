# docker-ecr-github-action
This project involves using GitHub Actions to automate the uploading of Docker images to AWS ECR. Define a workflow for the efficient, safe, and optimized creation and deployment of images by creating a GitHub repository, writing a Dockerfile, configuring AWS ECR, and more.

## GitHub Actions Workflow

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The workflow is triggered on each push to the main branch.

### Workflow Steps:

- **Step 1:** Check out the code.
- **Step 2:** Configure AWS credentials using GitHub repository secrets.
- **Step 3:** Login to Amazon ECR.
- **Step 4:** Build, tag, and push the Docker image to Amazon ECR.

### Secrets:

To set up the GitHub Actions workflow, you need to add the following secrets in your repository settings:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key ID.
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS secret access key.

### Local Development:

If you want to run the workflow locally, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Set up AWS credentials.
3. Run the workflow locally using the GitHub CLI.

### Troubleshooting:

If you encounter any issues, check the GitHub Actions logs for detailed information.
